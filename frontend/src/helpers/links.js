/**
 * What a link in a page's content is pointing at.
 *
 * One definition, because two renderers ask it: the markdown pipeline marks external links as it
 * renders them, and the WYSIWYG editor decides the same thing as a link is written -- its output IS
 * the render, so there is no later pass to mark anything in.
 */

/**
 * Whether a link leaves this wiki.
 *
 * Resolved against the page's own address, so a relative path, an absolute one and a protocol-relative
 * URL are all judged the same way -- by the host they end up on. `mailto:`, `tel:` and the rest are not
 * pages at all, and are left unmarked: they announce themselves by what they are.
 *
 * With no document to resolve against -- a render outside a browser -- only an absolute URL can be
 * judged, and it is judged external; a relative one fails to parse and comes back internal.
